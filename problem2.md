Problem 2. Get a computer program for distinguishing a randomly generated sequence of zeroes and ones from a cooked-up one. You are welcome to write the program yourself or use what can you find on the web or in some book. Test your program on the following two sequences: the sequence consisting of the concatenation of all numbers in binary form1
0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111 1000...
and a similar sequence consisting of the concatenation of all prime numbers in binary form
0 1 10 11 101 111 1011 ...
The first sequence (the fractional part of the Champernowne number) is known to be random when considered in base 10; the second sequence (the fractional part of the Copeland-Erd Ìˆos constant in binary form) is known to be random. In both cases, randomness is understood in a very specific way,2 and you are welcome to discuss this point too.
